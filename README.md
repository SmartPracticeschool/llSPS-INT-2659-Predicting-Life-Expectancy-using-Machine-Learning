# llSPS-INT-2659-Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning

Project Name: Predicting Life Expectancy using machine learning<br>
Kick off date: 06-06-2020<br>

<h3>Project Summary:</h3>
A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live.

<h3>Project Requirements:</h3>
A dataset suitable to solve the problem, Python platform, IBM cloud, IBM watson, IBM machine learning service and node red.

<h3>Functional Requirements:</h3>
Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. 

<h3>Technical Requirements:</h3>
Machine learning algorithms
IBM cloud
IBM watson
Node red

<h3>Software Requirements:</h3>
Python platform either jupyter or spider
IBM cloud and IBM watson studio

<h3>Project Deliverables:</h3>
This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.

<h3>Project Team:</h3>
Indiviual project and will be done under the instructions of mentor from Smartinternz.
